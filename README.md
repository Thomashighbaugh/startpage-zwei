# Startpage Zwei

A startpage hosted on Vercel that was written using

- `TSX` = `Typescript` + `React`
- `talilwind.css`
- `nextjs`
- `lottiefiles` - animations for the weather icon
-

## Selecting News Stories to Read

For now, the mouse hovering a story will select it and then pressing the left arrow opens the file (or displays a popup blocked notification)

## Looking for the More Colorful Version

Recently I made the startpage match my overall [window manager](https://github.com/the-Electric-Tantra-Linux/awesome) and [firefox](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/firefox) themes, but the old version is still available!

Just check the branches for this repository and `bam!` the colorful, A E S T H E T I C variant is all yours.

## Prospective

In the due course of time I hope to include:

- a menu with the ability to change theme settings, especially wallpaper (or dynamically themed svgs)
- extra pop out menu for links
- potentially a more `pomme page` like set of squares that can be dynamically changed
- better controls for the news items
